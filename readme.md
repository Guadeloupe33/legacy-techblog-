## Introduction
Writing about tech can be just as important as making it. Developers spend plenty of time creating new applications and debugging existing codebases, but most developers also spend at least some of their time reading and writing about technical concepts, recent advancements, and new technologies.

The **Tech Blog** is a CMS-style blog site, similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts. The site is built from scratch and deployed to Heroku. It adheres to the Model-View-Controller (MVC) paradigm, using Handlebars.js for templating, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration functionality.
- **Blog Posting**: Users can write, edit, and delete their blog posts.
- **Comments**: Users can comment on posts written by other users.
- **Responsive Design**: The site is fully responsive and works on various devices and screen sizes.

## Technologies
- **Handlebars.js**: Templating language.
- **Sequelize**: ORM for database management.
- **Express-session**: For handling user sessions.
- **Node.js and Express.js**: Server-side scripting.
- **MySQL**: Database.
- **Heroku**: Deployment platform.
